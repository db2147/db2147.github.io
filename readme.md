# About Me

<img src="assets\images\Dave-profile-pic.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 150px; float: right;" /> David Bierma grew up in Houston, and has always been fascinated by how things are put together.&nbsp;  From a young age he cultivated a love for music, which has been a way for him to express creativity and provide a positive outlet in his life.  &nbsp;  He honed his musical skills at Houston’s High School for Performing and Visual Arts.&nbsp; He then went on to study performance at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA, where he graduated with honors.&nbsp;  Coding is a natural extension of David’s interest in how things are put together. &nbsp; David plans to take the skills he’s learned in bootcamp and continue to grow as a full stack web developer.
